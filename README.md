### About The Project

The purpose of this project was to build a single-page web application portfolio, for the intent to provide academic work and educational evidence to prospective employers.

The basic structure of the page is a single page web application, with a video landing page, and a circular menu. Integrated, with four main sections- Welcome, Portfolio, About, Contact- followed by a footer.

Differently from what I envisioned at the beginning of the project the portfolio section had a sub-menu instead of a modal with nested carousels. I featured the sub-menu with three sections and included two iframes; for a finished website and my projects in CodePen and one image gallery built with JavaScript.

I successfully included firebase on my contact form using JavaScript, also for my own matrix and data control, I decided to add Google Analytics. One main issue that I faced, was the implementation of the carousel as a nested element of another. The idea sounds appealing in my head, however, its implementation did not work quite good as I expected. I decided then, focus on the main issue -How to get an interface that is compelling and the target audience will not have to be re-directed to a different page- I decided then to use the nested menu instead of a carousel and add the iframes and image gallery in three sections. It worked great and the I accomplished the main issue which provided a nice interactive interface to the end-user without the need to use a different page.

In the future, I would like to add in my portfolio, couple more projects but keep an interact interface, I want my target audience to be able to access and interact with everything in the portfolio, building something that is more engaged. I would like to add a section or a link leading to another page with Software Development step-by-step guides. Finally, I would like to implement it utilizing a framework, specifically, to re-build it using React.
